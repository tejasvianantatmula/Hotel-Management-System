 Hotel Management System

This Java-based hotel management system provides a comprehensive solution for managing hotel operations, including room bookings, food orders, and room availability tracking. The system is designed to be easy to understand, modify, and extend, making it suitable for small to medium-sized hotels.

 Features

- Room Booking: Users can book single or double rooms based on availability.
- Food Ordering: Guests can order food items to be delivered to their rooms.
- Room Availability: Real-time tracking of available rooms by type (single/double).
- Data Persistence: Hotel data is persisted using object serialization, ensuring data integrity between program executions.
- Concurrency: Separate threads are used for file I/O operations, preventing blocking and improving system responsiveness.

 Usage

1. Compile: Compile the Java files using any Java compiler.
2. Run: Execute the `Main` class file to launch the hotel management system.
3. Interact: Use the menu-driven interface to perform various tasks such as booking rooms, ordering food, and checking room availability.
4. Exit: Exit the program when done. The system will automatically save hotel data to the 'backup' file for future use.

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
